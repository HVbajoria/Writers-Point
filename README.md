## Theme : 
To create an application that will allow everyone to bring out their creativity and create, and share content without worrying about security and privacy. A place where the creators can directly interact with the users and get appreciated for their work. 

## Problem Statement:
Expressing your thoughts, and emotions have never been more important than now. In this digital age, it has become a need for an end to end security, more privacy of data, and gives the right appreciation creators should be receiving. 
* There is currently no content-sharing application in the market that gives authority to the users. The central authority can take decisions as per their will. 
* No application that allows the viewers to directly reward the creator without the involvement of a third person or a third party. 
* Good popular applications usually charge a huge fee to creators to publish their content. 
* No application that encourages everyone to create content and share them under a pen name with complete security. 
* Provide the right ownership to the content creator and avoid plagiarism of content. 

## Solution: üí° 
**Writers Point** is the solution to the above problems that will encourage everyone to create content and share them with the world digitally under a pen name. This comes with an end-to-end security of Polygon blockchain and methodology that allows the creators to stay completely private. It will give the right ownership to the content creators and the rights which they deserve for their creations. 
* This application runs on top of Polygon blockchain which comes with enhanced security and privacy of data, and seamless transactions. 
* This is a decentralized application that gives equal rights to each and every user. So, now central authority can take a decision and modify, add, remove or promote a particular content. 
* It allows direct interaction of the viewer with the content creator. Viewers can directly send a token of appreciation directly to the user with complete security.
* No extra charges, commissions are taken from the creators to publish their content except a small gas fee. 
* The application is fast, simple, and easy to use which will encourage everyone to explore the creators within them and share their creations with the world. 

## Tech Stack:
The following tech stacks have been used to create the application and deploy it.  
* **React JS** to build the front end of the application that supports most of the platform.
